## 40 years of high temperature superconductivity, what can quantum computing do for us

In 1986 high temperature superconductivity was discoverd and quickly the experienced theorists
suggested models to understand it. Now, 40 years later, they still do not agree and still can not predict the superconducting temperature. This is mostly due to the computational complexity of quantum mechanic problems, which is exponential in the number of particles.

If you follow media announcements, quantum computers will become available soon, or what is called soon if you want to have money to work with. So we tried to implement a possible algorithm to calculate the ground state energy of one of the top candidates, the Hubbard model. This was already 40 years ago one of the top models.

The allowed operations on a quantum computer are very restricted by physics. Therefore you really have to develop completely new algorithms and it is fun to see, that many parts of possible algorithms are just published in the last few years. The improved approach we used was published on arXiv in 2025, carefully investigating in which cases the complexity does not grow exponentially for larger sizes.

Our small 2x2 lattice uses all the building blocks, that would make it possible to do much greater lattices. But even this small lattice, which can be solved exactly within seconds on a laptop, uses about 10.000.000 gates, which according to the IBM roadmap, might be available 2029. Useful sizes to become available much later...

Decide for yourself, if you want to start your scientific career in this field.
